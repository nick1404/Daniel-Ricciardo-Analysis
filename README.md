# Analyzing and Predicting Daniel's Ricciardo F1 Performance Using Machine Learning

The data used in this project was taken from [StatsF1](statsf1.com) and [Racefans](Racefans.net).

I am a big fan of Formula 1, and one of my favourite drivers is Daniel Ricciardo, known for his speed, amazing overtakes and big smile.

Naturally, I was very excited to analyse his perfomance and add a machine learning aspect to the analysis. In this project we will:
- determine Daniel's best season in F1 and whether his performance improved with time;
- explore what his most successful circuits are (where he received the greatest amount of points);
- explore his performance at qualifying and see where he qualified the highest;
- investigate the correlation between Daniel Ricciardo's qualifying results and points received in a Grand Prix race;
- develop two machine learning models that predict his performance in 2019 based on the previous seasons.
